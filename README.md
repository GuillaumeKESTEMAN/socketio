# socketio
I started to use the socketio module because I found it interesting.
I add a pseudo system, log file which been reset after each use.
When you arrived in the middle of a discussion you can see the old messages thanks to the file "messages.txt" which is reset after each use.

PS : To have the node_modules you need to do an : "npm install"
